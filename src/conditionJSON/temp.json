I reviewed the data from various clinical trials including the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT) that was conducted in the 1990s, followed by the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR).  The BCPT was a large randomized controlled trial of over 20,000 women with an increased lifetime risk of breast cancer who were randomized to either receive tamoxifen 20 mg p.o. daily or placebo.  The women who took tamoxifen had a 50% risk reduction in developing invasive cancers which led to the approval of this drug for this reason.  I also reviewed the STAR data indicating that raloxifene can lead to a similar risk reduction in postmenopausal women, with a lesser risk of endometrial cancer and venous thromboembolic events than tamoxifen, and can actually improve bone density.  I described the risks, benefits and side effects of tamoxifen with her today including the risk of hot flashes and other vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness, decreased libido, mood changes including depression, increased risk of endometrial cancer and venous thromboembolic events (approximately 4 in 1000 women)"},{"id":86,"name":"test","preceptor":"","date":"","selected":true,"hidden":true},{"id":87,"name":"Mantle Cell Lymphoma","preceptor":"O'Malley","date":"09/12/2017","selected":false,"whatWasLearned":"Cyclin D1 is gene marker.\nVery agressive."}]
